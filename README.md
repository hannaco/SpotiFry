# Welcome to SpotiFry

## About the Application
The motivation behind our application is to allow users to discover new music based on their current listening tastes. Additionally, we wanted to allow users to generate customized playlists with a particular artist, genre, or sound in mind. Thus, we created this application.

## Using the application
Our application is deployed and accessible at https://spotifry-app.herokuapp.com/. Check out our wiki for more extensive usage instructions!

## About the Team
Our team is composed of four UCLA undergraduate computer science majors. This project was completed as a part of our senior capstone.

## Running the app and triggering a build
1. Run `npm install` in the root directory of the app and run `pipenv install` in the backend-awesome directory
2. Configure the app for a local run by changing the proxy to localhost:3000 in package.json
3. The app can be run locally by running `npm start` in the root directory of the app and running `pipenv python driver.py` in the backend-awesome directory

To build the app you can run `npm build`
